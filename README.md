# Functional Connectivity Regressor

This project aims to predict age based on functional connectivity derived from fMRI data using a deep learning approach by analyzing fMRI data during movie watching. The project leverages functional connectivity matrices extracted from fMRI data as input features for a neural network regressor. The experiment uses the Developmental fMRI Dataset, which consists of fMRI scans of children (ages 3-13) and young adults (ages 18-39) while they watched movies. This dataset is ideal for demonstrating how machine learning models can be trained to classify participants based on brain connectivity patterns.


## Results

### 1. **Precuneus Superior – Superior Fornix and Isthmus** (Importance: 0.474181)

   - **Role in Film Watching**: 
     The **precuneus** is strongly activated during reflective thinking and **self-referential processes**, such as when people relate what they see to their own experiences or emotions. During a film, this could involve **empathy**, placing oneself in the situation of a character, or daydreaming.
     The **fornix**, a memory-related structure, likely aids in recalling **past experiences** and **emotional memories**, which can influence how individuals relate to the narrative.
   
   - **Age Prediction**: 
     Age-related changes in memory networks like the **fornix** could alter how older participants recall or relate to the film's plot and characters, possibly making this connection a key feature in predicting age.

### 2. **Parieto-Occipital Sulcus Superior – Cerebellum Crus II** (Importance: 0.410588)

   - **Role in Film Watching**: 
     The **parieto-occipital sulcus** is associated with **visual-spatial processing** and understanding **scenes**. The **cerebellum**, particularly **Crus II**, has been linked to both **motor coordination** and **cognitive functions**, including **language processing** and **working memory**.
     This connection may become active during scenes requiring **visual tracking** of characters or objects moving across the screen, or interpreting spatial relationships in a scene.
   
   - **Age Prediction**: 
     As people age, the integration of visual and motor information may decline, impacting their ability to **track movement** or **process complex scenes**. This could be a strong indicator of age-related cognitive decline.

### 3. **Inferior Occipital Gyrus – Superior Parietal Lobule Anterior** (Importance: 0.394484)

   - **Role in Film Watching**: 
     The **inferior occipital gyrus** is a core region for **visual processing**, particularly in recognizing objects and faces, while the **superior parietal lobule** helps integrate this visual information with **spatial attention**.
     When watching a film, this connection likely supports the identification of characters, facial expressions, and objects in motion, as well as **directing attention** to important visual elements on the screen.
   
   - **Age Prediction**: 
     Age-related changes in visual processing and attention allocation could alter how older individuals perceive and focus on key elements in a film, making this connection relevant for predicting cognitive aging.

### 4. **Intraparietal Sulcus (Left Hemisphere) – Cuneus** (Importance: 0.370234)

   - **Role in Film Watching**: 
     The **intraparietal sulcus (IPS)** is critical for **visuospatial attention**, while the **cuneus** processes **basic visual stimuli** such as motion and orientation. Together, these regions help the brain **focus on moving objects**, track **changes in visual scenes**, and interpret **dynamic visuals** like those in a film.
   
   - **Age Prediction**: 
     As individuals age, their ability to maintain attention on dynamic stimuli (e.g., fast-paced scenes or sudden visual changes) may decline, making this connection key in predicting cognitive slowdown in older participants.

### 5. **Superior Temporal Sulcus with Angular Gyrus – Lingual Gyrus Anterior** (Importance: 0.365849)

   - **Role in Film Watching**: 
     The **superior temporal sulcus** plays a major role in **social perception**, such as recognizing **facial expressions** and **understanding intentions**. The **angular gyrus** is important for **language processing** and **semantic understanding**. The **lingual gyrus**, part of the visual cortex, processes **visual word recognition** and **scene recognition**.
     During a film, this connection would be vital for interpreting **social cues** between characters, understanding the **plot**, and linking **visual and linguistic elements**.
   
   - **Age Prediction**: 
     As social and language processing regions decline with age, older adults may show altered responses to **dialogue**, **character interactions**, or **plot comprehension**, making this connection valuable for predicting cognitive aging.

## Experimental Setup

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing**:
   - **Data Source**: The data used is from the `development_fmri` dataset obtained via Nilearn, containing fMRI images and associated confound variables.
   - **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration includes loading and inspecting the dataset for functional and confound files, as well as participant demographics such as age and gender.

2. **Connectivity Analysis**:
   - **Atlas Definition**: Difumo atlas is used to define 64 brain regions of interest (ROIs) for extracting functional connectivity.
   - **Connectivity Estimation**: Nilearn's `MultiNiftiMapsMasker` is employed to extract time series from ROIs and `ConnectivityMeasure` computes correlation matrices to quantify connectivity.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - **Feature Selection**: Features derived from connectivity matrices are used to predict participant age.
   - **Model Architecture**: A non-linear regression model is defined using PyTorch, optimized via Optuna for hyperparameters like hidden layer sizes, dropout rates, and learning rates.
   - **Training and Evaluation**: The model is trained using `AdamW` optimizer with early stopping based on validation loss, evaluated using MSE, MAE, and R² metrics.

4. **Findings and Insights**:
   - **Neuroscientific Insights**: Significant brain regions contributing to age prediction are identified through feature importance analysis using perturbation methods.
   - **Visualization**: Visualizations such as histograms, connectivity matrices, and feature importance plots provide intuitive insights into data patterns and model outcomes.

## Summary

1. **Functional Connectivity Patterns**:
   - Strong correlations between specific brain regions suggest coordinated activity networks.
   - Variations in connectivity strength across age groups indicate developmental changes in brain organization.

2. **Impact of Age on Connectivity**:
   - Age-related changes in connectivity metrics reflect ongoing neural maturation and functional specialization.
   - Differential patterns between children and adults highlight distinct stages of cognitive development and aging effects.
